# idea of this code is to find which files havent been checked, renamed and saved into the reserves
# will need to combine all the excel files from the downloaded version (from the reserves) with the massive file to find the 'missing' unsaved files 

import pandas as pd

# asks file name
file1_path = input("Type the name of entire orientation file (including the file type): ")
file2_path = input("Type the name of the saved orientation file (including the file type): ")

df1 = pd.read_excel(file1_path)
df2 = pd.read_excel(file2_path)

merged = pd.merge(df1, df2, how='outer', indicator=True)
missing_inputs = merged[merged['_merge'] == 'left_only']

missing_inputs.to_excel("missing_inputs.xlsx", index=False)
